    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about
    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.
    
    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with
    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.

    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.

### Reproducible Demo

<!--
  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.
  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.

  There are two ways to do it:

    * Create a new project and try to reproduce the issue in it.
      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.

    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.
      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.

  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve
  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:

(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)
